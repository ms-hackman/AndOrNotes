We can use the ideas of AND, OR, and NOT that we learned in our logic gates lesson and apply them to our p5js programming! Instead of using AND, OR, and NOT gates, we use AND, OR and NOT operators in our programs. These operators will let us combine boolean expressions to make more complex if statements. 

# NOT Operator

The NOT operator acts just like the NOT logic gate: it takes in a boolean value and spits out the opposite boolean value. If you input true, it will output false, and if you input false, it will output true. The NOT operator in p5js is the <code>!</code> point.
